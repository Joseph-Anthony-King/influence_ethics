[h1]Influence Ethics Espionage Operation[/h1]

This mod adds a new espionage operation, influence ethics, which permits you to exert influence on the target empire's internal ethics.  This is a two stage operation and after the successful completion of the second step you will exert influence on the target empires ethics for five years.

The target empire will then receive modifiers for the five year period for each ethic in your empire.

If it's a regular ethic it will receive a 70% modifier with the alternate ethic receiving a negative 70% modifier (i.e. xenophile vs. xenophobe), all other ethics will receive a negative 10% modifier.

If it's a fanatic ethic it will receive a 100% modifier with the alternate ethic receiving a negative 90% modifier, all other ethics will receive a negative 10% modifier.

These modifiers are cumulative so if you have a fanatic ethic and a regular ethic your fanatic ethic will receive a 90% modifier, it's alternate ethic will receive a negative 100% modifier, with your regular ethic receiving a 60% modifier and all other ethics receiving a negative 20% modifier.

It is important to note this will be an influence and does not allow you to direct the target empire's ethics... beware unintended consequences...
